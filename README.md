# Rackpropagator

Reverse-mode automatic differentiation of Racket programs.

This library is a work in progress: expect breaking changes, bugs, and
a number of limitations.

A particular caution: Currently, performance of the generated code can
be very poor in some situations.

- Requires [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)
- Install with `raco pkg install rackpropagator`
- [Documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rackpropagator/)
